My Codecademy CS101 terminal game project

This is my text-based adventure.

It is still a bit riddled with bugs, but it basically does what I want it to do.

Future improvements will include:

- Fix bug that substitutes hero's weapon for the weapon the monster will drop
- Check for input's validity
- More detailed story and narration
